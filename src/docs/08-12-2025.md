## Applied Skills-Style Badges to Projects

### What Changed
Transformed project badges from simple text labels into interactive icon + name combinations, matching the visual design of the Skills section.

### Files Modified

1. **portfolioConfig.tsx**
   - Added `BADGE_MAP` structure to map badge keys to icon components
   - Created Badge interface with name and icon properties
   - Maps lowercase badge keys (typescript, go, c++, etc.) to proper icon components

2. **projects.tsx**
   - Updated badge rendering logic
   - Now uses `BADGE_MAP` to get icon component and display name
   - Renders each badge as `badge-item` with icon and name side-by-side

3. **content.css**
   - Removed old `.badge` styling (bordered boxes)
   - Added new `.badge-item` styling matching skills layout:
     - Horizontal flexbox layout (icon + name)
     - 24px icon size on desktop
     - Hover animations (translateY and brightness)
     - Clean typography with proper spacing
   - Mobile responsive:
     - 18px icons on mobile
     - Smaller font size (0.7rem)
     - Tighter gap spacing

### Visual Result
Before: `[typescript]` `[json]` - plain text in boxes
After: `[🔷 TypeScript]` `[📄 JSON]` - colorful icons with names, just like Skills section

### Key Design Principles Applied
- Data structured as interfaces (Badge interface in config)
- Simple, single-responsibility components
- Consistent styling across Skills and Projects sections
- Responsive design with mobile-specific adjustments
