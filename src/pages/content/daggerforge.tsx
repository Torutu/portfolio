    <h2 className="rightSideSection__h2">What is Daggerforge?</h2>
    <p className="rightSideSection__p">
      Daggerforge is an Obsidian plugin that helps people prepare and manage tabletop game sessions more easily.
      It lets users browse and organize game elements, create custom content, and insert it directly into their notes. 
      It includes tools for building interactive cards, tracking values, rolling dice, calculating encounter difficulty, 
      and arranging everything visually on Obsidian's canvas.

      <h3 className="rightSideSection__h3">What It Does</h3>
      <p className="rightSideSection__p">
        A sidebar panel that displays adversary cards with 
        real-time multi-filter search. Filter by name, tier level (1-4), 
        type (Bruiser, Horde, Solo, etc.), or content source. Click any 
        result to insert it into your note or canvas.
      </p>
      <h3 className="rightSideSection__h3">How It Works</h3>
      <p className="rightSideSection__p">
        Search engine maintains current filters 
        and searches across loaded adversaries. When you adjust any filter (name, tier, type, source), 
        it instantly re-queries the data and re-renders results. Built-in JSON data and 
        custom user-created adversaries are merged and displayed together.

        Converts data into styled HTML cards that 
        render directly in your notes. Cards include interactive HP/Stress checkboxes, weapon stats, 
        features, and visual badges showing difficulty and content source.

      <h3 className="rightSideSection__h3">How It Works</h3>
      <p className="rightSideSection__p">
        Takes data from .json files adversary and environment stat blocks 
        (HP, Damage, Difficulty, Features, etc.)
        and builds an HTML string. For each HP point, creates a checkbox. 
        Repeats the entire HP/Stress section based on adversary count.

        costs, and descriptions.

        unique identifier (CUA_timestamp_random).
